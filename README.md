# Chess Game with Voice and Text Command Integration

This project is a web-based chess game that allows players to move pieces either by typing commands or using voice recognition. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and supports moving chess pieces on a visual board.

## Features

- **Visual Chessboard**: A fully interactive chessboard with all standard chess pieces.
- **Text Command Input**: Move pieces by typing commands in the format `piece to square` (e.g., `black-pawn-1 to a4`).
- **Voice Command Integration**: Use voice recognition to control the chess pieces, allowing for a more interactive experience.
- **Sound Effects**: Play sounds when pieces are moved or captured.
- **Responsive Controls**: Separate control panels on the left and right sides for easy access to game functions.
